HTTPD = Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server / HyperText Transfer Protocol Daemon

httpd is a software program that runs in the background and serves as a web server, handling client requests and delivering web content.

It listens for incoming network requests (usually from web browsers) and responds by sending back the requested web pages, images, or other resources. 

httpd operates using a client-server model, where clients (like web browsers) send requests to the server (httpd) and the server responds with the requested data.
